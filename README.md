# Spencer's Photo Store

This is a monorepo project that combines a Django DRF backend with a React frontend. The purpose of this project is both to demostrate tech skills and to create a working photo store where users can browse and purchase images. While the photography aspect is secondary, it provides a real-world use case for integrating user authentication, payments, and file uploads.

## Tech Stack

### Backend (Django DRF)

- Django & Django REST Framework
- JWT Authentication (djangorestframework-simplejwt)
- SQLite (for now, but can be swapped for PostgreSQL later)
- CORS handling (django-cors-headers)
- Environment variables (django-environ)

### Frontend (React)

- React (with Tailwind + DaisyUI for styling)
- JWT handling via localStorage
- API calls to Django

### Payments

- Stripe (to handle transactions for purchasing images)

## Progress So Far

âœ… Monorepo structure set up (Backend: Django, Frontend: React)  
âœ… Django project initialized with DRF  
âœ… JWT Authentication implemented (Login, Register, Refresh Tokens)  
âœ… SQLite database configured with environment variables  
âœ… CORS set up for React-Django communication  

## Why JWT for Authentication?

I chose JWT (JSON Web Tokens) instead of session-based authentication because:

- It works well with a React frontend (tokens are stored in localStorage or cookies).
- It's scalable â€“ allows mobile apps or third-party clients to authenticate easily.
- No reliance on Django's built-in session handling, making it better for APIs.
- Tokens can be refreshed without requiring the user to log in again immediately.

JWT is a widely used method for securing stateless APIs, making it a good fit for this project.

## Next Steps

- ðŸ”œ Connect React frontend to JWT authentication (login/signup pages)
- ðŸ”œ Implement user profiles (fetch user info after login)
- ðŸ”œ Set up photo uploads (Cloudinary or local storage?)
- ðŸ”œ Start Stripe integration for payments

Keep your eyes peeled - more to come!
